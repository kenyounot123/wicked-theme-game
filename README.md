# SLP Telepractice Application

## Overview
A screen-based application designed to support Speech-Language Pathologists (SLPs) in delivering telepractice services to their clients. This project addresses the growing need for digital therapeutic tools in response to the increased adoption of telepractice during and after the Covid-19 pandemic.

- Gamification elements have been proven to increase client motivation and engagement (Aghlara, 2011)

## Project Development
This application is the result of a collaborative effort between:
- An SLP graduate student
- An experienced app designer

## Features
- Screen-based therapeutic activities
- Gamified learning objectives
- AI-assisted functionality
